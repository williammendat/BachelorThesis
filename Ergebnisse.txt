Analyse:
Papers [19] and [20] were selected to adapt the
evaluation methodology used in this study. It covers the
evaluation conditions, evaluation scenarios, evaluation
metrics, and software/hardware settings that were adopted
and used to evaluate the performance of different GUI
components; using small pieces of code corresponding to a
specific GUI functionality. 

Bedingungen für die Analyse:
A. Evaluation Conditions
Several evaluation conditions were taken into account in
this research, as follows:
● Default configurations and settings of the integrated
development environments (IDEs) were used.
● The same computer system with the same
software/hardware specifications was used for the
selected scenarios to be programmed and executed.
● All user programs (except the used IDEs) were
closed before conducting the experiments and
measurements.
● The Internet was switched off from the computer
while evaluating the scenarios.
● Each of the scenarios was executed 1000 times;
then, the average execution time has been taken for
more accuracy.
● The execution time has been measured only for the
execution of each code mentioned in the scenarios. 

Scenarien:
1. Creating an empty combo box. 
2. Creating a new label. 
3. Creating a new button.
4. Creating a new checkbox
5. Creating a new radio button. 
6. Creating a new list box containing five elements. 
7. Creating a new text field.
8. Creating a new password field.
9. Reading the value of a text field.
- Writing a Label 
- Writing a Textbox 
11. Checking a checkbox. It was unchecked before each iteration.
12. Checking a radio button. It was unchecked before each iteration.
13. Unchecking a checkbox. It was checked before each iteration. 
14. Unchecking a radio button. It was checked before each iteration. 
15. Checking the value of a radio button. It was checked before each iteration. 
16. Checking the value of a check box. It was checked before each iteration.
